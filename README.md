# COVID-19 Statistics Dashboard

This project is a modular and scalable React application for displaying and analyzing COVID-19 statistics. It demonstrates proficiency in React best practices, data handling, state management, and data visualization.

## Features

- Modular Component Design: The application is structured into reusable components including Dashboard, StatisticsDisplay, HistoricalDataChart, StateSelectionDropdown, DataComparisonModule, and DataFilteringSortingModule.
- Advanced State Management: Redux is used for global state management, and custom hooks are implemented for local state management and data fetching.
- Display Current COVID-19 Statistics: The StatisticsDisplay component presents the latest COVID-19 statistics.
- Historical Data Visualization: The HistoricalDataChart component uses Chart.js to provide line or bar charts showing trends over time.
- State Selection Dropdown: The StateSelectionDropdown component allows users to select different states and dynamically update the dashboard to display relevant data.
- Data Comparison Feature: The DataComparisonModule enables comparison of COVID-19 statistics between states.
- Data Filtering and Sorting: The DataFilteringSortingModule provides advanced data interaction with filtering and sorting capabilities based on case numbers, dates, or other metrics.
- Performance Optimization: The application uses memoization and lazy loading for performance enhancement, and optimizes data fetching and state updates for efficiency.
- TypeScript Integration: The application employs TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
